# Logistic Regression Model for Hate Speech Detection

---

## Overview

This project aims to detect hate speech using a logistic regression model. Hate speech detection is a crucial task in natural language processing, particularly for maintaining a healthy online environment. This model utilizes logistic regression, a widely used classification algorithm, to classify text data into hate speech or non-hate speech categories.

---

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset consisting of labeled examples of hate speech and non-hate speech. The dataset is obtained from [source], and it includes text samples along with their corresponding labels.

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, lowercasing, and removal of stopwords and punctuation to prepare it for model training.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Text features are extracted using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to represent each text sample numerically.

3. **Model Training**: The logistic regression model is trained on the preprocessed text features and corresponding labels.

4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a held-out test set.

## Usage

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Training**: Train the logistic regression model using the provided dataset:

    ```
    python train_model.py --dataset <path_to_dataset>
    ```

3. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict hate speech:

    ```
    python predict.py --text "Your text goes here."
    ```

## Evaluation

The model achieves the following performance metrics on the test set:

- **Accuracy**: 
- **Precision**: 
- **Recall**: 
- **F1-score**:

## Future Improvements

1. **Model Tuning**: Explore hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance further.
2. **Ensemble Methods**: Experiment with ensemble methods to boost classification accuracy.
3. **Data Augmentation**: Augment the dataset with synthetic examples to address class imbalance and improve generalization.
